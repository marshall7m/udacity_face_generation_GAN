# udacity_face_generation_GAN

# Description:

This project involved creating a trained DCGAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network) using the [CelebA dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/celeba-dataset) found on Kaggle. As the models train, the generator model will produce sample images that were created during each epoch.  Here are some of the generated images from epoch 10:
